#Learning ggplot2

We're learning ggplot2 It's going to be amazing.

###NOTE click "insert >R" at top of editor pane
###from CRAN:
```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

x <- mpg
?mpg

#define aesthetics (aes), by selecting the variables to be plotted and the
#variables to define the presentation such as plotting size, shape color, etc.

#add geoms - graphical representation of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms; we will use some common ones today, including:

    #geom_point() for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
    #geom_bar() for bar charts
    #geom_line() for trend lines, time-series, etc


ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + geom_point()

#OR

# Assign plot to a variable
car_plot <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# Draw the plot
car_plot + geom_point()

#from here

```
