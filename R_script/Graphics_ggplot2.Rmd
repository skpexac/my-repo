#Learning ggplot2

We're learning ggplot2 It's going to be amazing.

###NOTE click "insert >R" at top of editor pane
###from CRAN:
```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

t <- mpg #cretae object and call t to view
?mpg

#define aesthetics (aes), by selecting the variables to be plotted and the
#variables to define the presentation such as plotting size, shape color, etc.

#add geoms - graphical representation of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms; we will use some common ones today, including:

    #geom_point() for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
    #geom_bar() for bar charts
    #geom_line() for trend lines, time-series, etc


ggplot(data=mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) +
  geom_point()

#OR

# Assign plot to a variable
car_plot <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# Draw the plot
car_plot + 
  geom_point()

#add transparency
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.4)

#map class to colour
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = class))

#map class to shape
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

#Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cty with different size points representing each car class and different colors for each fuel type.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, size = class, color = fl))

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "blue")

#ggplot has a special technique called faceting that allows the user to split one plot into multiple plots based on a factor included in the dataset. We will use it to make a plot of the highway miles (hwy) a car gets by its engine size (displ) for each car manufacturer:

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~ manufacturer)

#split class by colour
 ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
     geom_point() +
     facet_wrap(~ manufacturer)
 
#plot on white background
 ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
     geom_point() +
     facet_wrap(~ manufacturer) +
     theme_bw()
#plot on white background & remove brder and grid lines
 ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
     geom_point() +
     facet_wrap(~ manufacturer) +
     theme_bw() + 
     theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))
 
 #(geoms)
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter()
 
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
 
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_violin()
 
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
 
 ?geom_smooth
 #add multiple geoms
 
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
 
 #to avoid duplication of code
 ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
 
#If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.
 ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
 
#Take a look at the ggplot2 cheat sheet, and think of ways you could improve the plot.Now, let's change names of axes to something more informative than 'hwy' and 'displ' and add a title to the figure:

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between engine size and miles per gallon (mpg)",
         x = "Highway MPG",
         y = "Engine displacement (liters)") +
  theme_bw()
 
#The axes have more informative names, but their readability can be improved by increasing the font size:

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between engine size and mpg",
         x = "Highway MPG",
         y = "Engine displacement (liters)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text=element_text(size = 16))

#change legend title
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between engine size and mpg",
         x = "Highway MPG",
         y = "Engine displacement (liters)") 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text=element_text(size = 16))

  labs(fill="NEW LEGEND TITLE")
  
#whether colour of fill would work depends on what "cond" (or group in other cases) is really mapped to. A good explanation could be found in cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2) - user1442363 Jan 30 at 12:28
